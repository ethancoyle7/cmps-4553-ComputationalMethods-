SUMMER TRIP
Last summer, my mom and dad took me on a trip to PLACE .  The weather there is very ADJECTIVE ! There, they have many  PLURALNOUN , and they make ADJECTIVE  PLURALNOUN there. Many people also go there to VERB  or see PLURALNOUN .  The people that live there love to eat PLURALNOUN and are very proud of their big NOUN .  They also like to VERB in the sun and VERB in the lake!  It was a really  ADJECTIVE  trip!
